Place arcana ability sound files in this folder.

Naming convention:
- Use the arcana id as the filename.
- Supported formats: .mp3 (preferred), .ogg (fallback)

Examples:
- shield_pawn.mp3
- sacrifice.mp3
- time_travel.mp3

These files will be loaded automatically by the client as `arcana:<id>` (e.g. `arcana:shield_pawn`).

If you add new arcana, create the corresponding audio file using the arcana id as the filename.
